Purple is a color intermediate between blue and red. It is similar to
violet, but unlike violet, which is a spectral color with its own
wavelength on the visible spectrum of light, purple is a composite color
made by combining red and blue. According to surveys In Europe and the
U.S., purple is the color most often associated with royalty, magic,
mystery and piety. When combined with pink, it is associated with
eroticism, femininity and seduction.

Purple was the color worn by Roman magistrates; it became the imperial
color worn by the rulers of the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman
Empire, and later by Roman Catholic bishops. Similarly in Japan, the
color is traditionally associated with the Emperor and aristocracy. The
complementary color of purple is yellow.
