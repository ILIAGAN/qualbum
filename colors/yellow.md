Yellow is the color between green and orange on the spectrum of visible
light. It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength of roughly
570–590 nm. In traditional color theory, used in painting, and in the
subtractive color system, used in color printing, yellow is a primary
color. In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and
computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and
green at equal intensity.

The word yellow comes from the Old English geolu, geolwe (oblique case),
meaning "yellow, yellowish", derived from the Proto-Germanic word gelwaz
"yellow". It has the same Indo-European base, gʰel-, as the words gold
and yell, or "cry out."

According to surveys in Europe, Canada, and the United States, yellow is
the color people most often associate with amusement, gentleness, and
spontaneity, but also with duplicity, envy, jealousy, avarice, and, in
the U.S., with cowardice. In Iran it has connotations of
pallor/sickness, but also wisdom and connection. It plays an important
role in Asian culture, particularly in China, where it is seen as the
color of happiness, glory, wisdom, harmony, and culture.
