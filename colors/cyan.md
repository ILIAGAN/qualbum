Cyan is a greenish-blue color. It is evoked by light with a predominant
wavelength of between 490â€“520 nm, between the wavelengths of blue and
green.

In the subtractive color system, or CMYK (subtractive), which can be
overlaid to produce all colors in paint and color printing, cyan is one
of the primary colors, along with magenta, yellow, and black. In the
additive color system, or RGB (additive) color model, used to create all
the colors on a computer or television display, cyan is made by mixing
equal amounts of green and blue light. Cyan is the complement of red; it
can be made by the removal of red from white light. Mixing red light and
cyan light at the right intensity will make white light.

The web color cyan is synonymous with aqua. Other colors in the cyan
color range are teal, turquoise, electric blue, aquamarine, and others
described as blue-green.
