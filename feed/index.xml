light. It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength of roughly
570–590 nm. In traditional color theory, used in painting, and in the
subtractive color system, used in color printing, yellow is a primary
color. In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and
computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and
green at equal intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word yellow comes from the Old English geolu, geolwe (oblique case),
meaning "yellow, yellowish", derived from the Proto-Germanic word gelwaz
"yellow". It has the same Indo-European base, gʰel-, as the words gold
and yell, or "cry out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to surveys in Europe, Canada, and the United States, yellow is
the color people most often associate with amusement, gentleness, and
spontaneity, but also with duplicity, envy, jealousy, avarice, and, in
the U.S., with cowardice. In Iran it has connotations of
pallor/sickness, but also wisdom and connection. It plays an important
role in Asian culture, particularly in China, where it is seen as the
color of happiness, glory, wisdom, harmony, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

visible light next to orange, at the opposite end from violet. Red color
has a predominant light wavelength of roughly 620–740 nanometers. Light
with a longer wavelength than red but shorter than terahertz radiation
and microwave is called infrared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red is one of the additive primary colors of visible light, along with
green and blue, which in the Red Green Blue (RGB) color system are
combined to create all the colors on a computer monitor or television
screen. Red is one of the subtractive secondary colors, resulting from
the combination of yellow and magenta, as in the CMYK color model.
Traditionally, it was viewed as a primary subtractive colour, along with
yellow and blue, in the RYB color space and traditional color wheel
formerly used by painters and artists. Reds can vary in shade from very
light pink to very dark maroon or burgundy; and in hue from the bright
orange-red scarlet or vermilion to the bluish-red crimson. Red is the
complementary color of cyan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, the red color of blood comes from hemoglobin, the
iron-containing protein found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates.
The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is
caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. It also
causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and
sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering,
which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the
red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is
caused by pigments called anthocyanins, which are produced towards the
end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced. One to
two percent of the human population has red hair; the color is produced
by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts
for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark
pigment eumelanin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated
with sacrifice, danger and courage. Modern surveys in the United States
and Europe show red is also the color most commonly associated with
heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love and joy. In China, India
and many other Asian countries it is the color of symbolizing happiness
and good fortune. Since the 19th century, red has also been associated
with socialism and communism.&lt;/p&gt;

It is similar to
violet, but unlike violet, which is a spectral color with its own
wavelength on the visible spectrum of light, purple is a composite color
made by combining red and blue. According to surveys In Europe and the
U.S., purple is the color most often associated with royalty, magic,
mystery and piety. When combined with pink, it is associated with
eroticism, femininity and seduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purple was the color worn by Roman magistrates; it became the imperial
color worn by the rulers of the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman
Empire, and later by Roman Catholic bishops. Similarly in Japan, the
color is traditionally associated with the Emperor and aristocracy. The
complementary color of purple is yellow.&lt;/p&gt;

light. It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength of roughly
495–570 nm. In the subtractive color system, used in painting and color
printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow
and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer
screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and
blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other
colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern English word green comes from the Middle English and
Anglo-Saxon word grene, from the same Germanic root as the words "grass"
and "grow". It is the color of living grass and leaves and as a result
is the color most associated with springtime, growth and nature. By far
the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical
by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical
energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by
taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a
green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its
chromium content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In surveys made in Europe and the United States, green is the color most
commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope and
envy. In Europe and the U.S., green is sometimes associated with death
(green has several seemingly contrary associations), sickness, or the
devil, but in China its associations are very positive, as the symbol of
fertility and happiness. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when the
color of clothing showed the owner's social status, green was worn by
merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was the color of the
nobility. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci wears green, showing she is
not from a noble family; the benches in the British House of Commons are
green, while those in the House of Lords are red. Green is also the
traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go
ahead, a green card permits permanent residence in the United States. It
is the most important color in Islam. It was the color of the banner of
Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries, and
represents the lush vegetation of Paradise. It is also often associated
with the culture of Gaelic Ireland, and is a color of the flag of
Ireland. Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the
environmental movement. Political groups advocating environmental
protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green
movement, some naming themselves Green parties. This has led to similar
campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or
environmentally friendly, products.&lt;/p&gt;

It is evoked by light with a predominant
wavelength of between 490–520 nm, between the wavelengths of blue and
green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the subtractive color system, or CMYK (subtractive), which can be
overlaid to produce all colors in paint and color printing, cyan is one
of the primary colors, along with magenta, yellow, and black. In the
additive color system, or RGB (additive) color model, used to create all
the colors on a computer or television display, cyan is made by mixing
equal amounts of green and blue light. Cyan is the complement of red; it
can be made by the removal of red from white light. Mixing red light and
cyan light at the right intensity will make white light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web color cyan is synonymous with aqua. Other colors in the cyan
color range are teal, turquoise, electric blue, aquamarine, and others
described as blue-green.&lt;/p&gt;

light. Human eyes perceive blue when observing light with a wavelength
between 450 and 495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a
shorter wavelength appear more violet, while those with a lower
frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Pure
blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres. In painting and
traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of
pigments, along with red and yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide
gamut of colours. Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and
yellow together form green. Blue is also a primary colour in the RGB
colour model, used to create all the colours on the screen of a
television or computer monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern English word blue comes from Middle English bleu or blewe,
from the Old French bleu, a word of Germanic origin related to Old
Dutch, Old High German, Old Saxon blāo and Old Frisian blāw, blau. The
clear sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect
known as Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight passes through the
atmosphere, the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen
and nitrogen molecules, and more blue comes to our eyes. An optical
effect called Tyndall scattering, similar to Rayleigh scattering,
explains blue eyes; there is no blue pigment in blue eyes. Distant
objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called
atmospheric perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue has been used for art and decoration since ancient times. The
semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, coming from mines in Afghanistan, was
used in ancient Egypt for jewelry and ornament and later, in The
Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all
pigments. It is the most important color in Judaism. In the Middle Ages,
cobalt blue was used to colour the stained glass windows of cathedrals.
Beginning in the 9th century, Chinese artists used cobalt to make fine
blue and white porcelain. Blue dyes for clothing were made from woad in
Europe and indigo in Asia and Africa. In 1828 a synthetic ultramarine
pigment was developed, and synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually
replaced mineral pigments and vegetable dyes. Pierre-Auguste Renoir,
Vincent van Gogh and other late 19th century painters used ultramarine
and cobalt blue not just to depict nature, but to create moods and
emotions. In the late 18th century and 19th century, blue became a
popular colour for military uniforms and police uniforms. In the 20th
century, because blue was commonly associated with harmony, it was
chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European
Union. Toward the end of the 20th century, dark blue replaced dark grey
as the most common colour for business suits; surveys showed that blue
was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black,
and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge,
calm and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly
associated with harmony, faithfulness, confidence, distance, infinity,
the imagination, cold, and sometimes with sadness. In US and European
public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost
half of both men and women as their favourite colour.&lt;/p&gt;
